# Welcome to CCINFOM S13 Group 3

This repository hosts our CCINFOM S13 group project, a database-driven system for managing medical records. The accompanying [project documentation](CCINFOM-Ramos-Latido-Berberabe-Chua.pdf) discusses the design goals, entities, and use cases in detail.

## Key Modules

- Patient records and medical histories
- Doctor information and specializations
- Disease classification and diagnoses
- Visits, laboratory procedures, and results

The SQL schema is provided in [`medical_db.sql`](medical_db.sql). The entity–relationship diagram below illustrates how the database objects relate to one another.
